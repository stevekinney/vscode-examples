## Visual Studio Code Exercises

Each directory contains little toy applications for debugging and running tasks and whatnot. This repo is not required for the course -- you can use your own projects as you work through the exercises.

## Install Dependencies

You can install the dependencies in each directory separately, or you can use something like `npx recursive-install`.
